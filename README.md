This project is originally a visual exploration of air traffic incidents involving Boeing aircraft over the past decade (January 1, 2014 - March 25, 2024) which is published on Behance  https://www.behance.net/gallery/195243851/Boeing-The-Last-Decade-in-Air-Traffic-Incidents

This R notebook is a the analysis that was done to prepare the data for visualization. 

Data Source:
Data for this project was gathered from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

Data Limitations:
For some incidents, the NTSB report may not specify the exact aircraft submodel and only specify the series. For instance, the Ethiopian Airlines crash of March 10, 2019, was reported as a 737 accident, not specifying it as a 737 MAX.
